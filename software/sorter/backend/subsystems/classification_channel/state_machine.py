# General no-progress watchdog: if a piece is physically on the classification
# channel (perception n_pieces > 0) but the flow makes NO progress for this
# long, the process is wedged — no matter WHICH state it's stuck in or which
# zone perception thinks the piece is in. "Progress" covers phase changes,
# track ids appearing/leaving, zone changes, substantial piece movement, and
# capture/classify milestones.
# With automatic handling the watchdog first tries to clear the channel itself
# (rotate forward up to _STALL_AUTO_CLEAR_MAX_TURNS full output turns, checking
# occupancy as it goes); only if that fails does it raise the operator
# exit-stuck incident. While the incident is active the flow is frozen and only
# the watchdog keeps running, so the incident auto-clears the moment perception
# sees the channel empty. The threshold is well above any normal single-state
# dwell (rotate/classify/discharge all transition within a few seconds).
